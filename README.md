# Rails + React + PG Template

This is my template project for quickly spinning up a web project with my usual stack of Rails on the backend, React on the frontend, and PG as a database. This template can be uploaded to Heroku for simple deployment.

## How to use

The project was initialized with the name `template`. Global search through the project for `template` to find some locations you should update to your actual project name, mostly just DB roles and module names and stuff. There aren't many places to adjust.

After doing that, this project is ready to go. Just be sure to install Postgres.
